## Project Description

The Guntroller is a device that one can use as a controller with a desktop computer in a household. It uses accelerometer/gyroscope on an Arduino to aim and and turn, a solenoid to shoot, and an Android smartphone as a pedometer to move.

### Milestones

#### Milestone I

- [ ] ~~Read accelerometer/gyroscope data~~ (Unable to finish due to parts not arriving)
- [x] Disassemble nerf gun and preparing as housing for later use
- [x] Develop a basic pedometer app that sends signals on step events for Android.

#### Milestone II

- [ ] Read accelerometer/gyroscope data (Moved from Milestone I)
- [ ] Read accelerometer/gyroscope data
- [ ] Process accelerometer/gyroscope data into appropriate inputs
- [ ] Establish a bluetooth connection between the pedometer app and microcontroller.

#### Milestone III (internal)

- [ ] Pedometer app uses bluetooth to send step signals to the microcontroller.
- [ ] Translate data inputs into game specific actions.

#### Final Demo

- [ ] Implement solenoid for recoil simulation.
- [ ] The controller's physical form resembles a gun.
- [ ] Final Presentation
